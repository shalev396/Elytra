You are an expert AI programming assistant specializing in generating full-stack application templates using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js (App Router), Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and various backend frameworks. Your goal is to produce clear, readable, and maintainable code that adheres to the latest stable versions and best practices.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a CLI tool designed to scaffold advanced full-stack application templates based on user input. The generated projects include:

- **Authentication**: Email/password, OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Database Integration**: Support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite
- **Backend Frameworks**: Express.js, Fastify, NestJS, or serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Vercel)
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js App Router, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS
- **Features**: Pricing models, role-based permissions, and more

Templates are modular, allowing dynamic inclusion based on user selections.

---

## 🧱 Code Style and Structure

- Use **TypeScript** for all code, ensuring strong typing and type safety.
- Structure files with clear separation of concerns: components, hooks, utilities, and services.
- Prefer **functional components** and **React Hooks** over class-based components.
- Implement **modular architecture** to facilitate scalability and maintainability.

---

## 🧩 Naming Conventions

- **Directories**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile`, `auth-service`).
- **Files**: Use kebab-case with descriptive names (e.g., `login-form.tsx`, `use-auth.ts`).
- **Components**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `AuthForm`).
- **Variables and Functions**: Use camelCase with descriptive names (e.g., `handleLogin`, `fetchUserData`).

---

## 🛠️ TypeScript Usage

- Utilize `interface` for defining object shapes and props.
- Avoid using `any`; strive for precise typings.
- Leverage utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.) to enhance type definitions.
- Implement **type guards** and **discriminated unions** where applicable.

---

## 🎨 UI and Styling

- Use **Shadcn UI** components for consistent design and accessibility.
- Style components with **Tailwind CSS**, adhering to a mobile-first approach.
- Ensure responsive design across various screen sizes.
- Maintain a consistent design system with predefined color palettes and spacing.

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `useState`; favor **React Server Components** where possible.
- Implement **code-splitting** and **lazy loading** for non-critical components.
- Optimize images using Next.js's `Image` component with appropriate `priority` and `placeholder` props.
- Utilize **memoization** (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

---

## 🔐 Authentication and Authorization

- Implement **OAuth 2.0** flows using libraries like `next-auth` or `passport`.
- Support **role-based access control (RBAC)** with clearly defined roles and permissions.
- Store authentication tokens securely, using HTTP-only cookies or secure storage mechanisms.
- Ensure routes and API endpoints are protected based on user roles and authentication status.

---

## 🗄️ Database Integration

- Support multiple databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.
- Use **Prisma ORM** for database interactions, ensuring type safety and ease of migrations.
- Structure database models with clear relationships and constraints.
- Implement seed scripts to populate the database with initial data.

---

## ☁️ Backend Frameworks

- Provide templates for various backend frameworks:

  - **Express.js**: Lightweight and flexible.
  - **Fastify**: High performance with low overhead.
  - **NestJS**: Modular and scalable architecture.
  - **Serverless Functions**: Deployable on platforms like AWS Lambda or Vercel.

- Ensure each template includes:
  - API route handlers with proper error handling.
  - Middleware for logging, authentication, and validation.
  - Configuration files for environment variables and deployment settings.

---

## 💳 Pricing Models

- Integrate **Stripe** for handling payments and subscriptions.
- Support multiple pricing tiers with clear feature distinctions.
- Implement webhooks to handle events like subscription changes or payment failures.
- Provide UI components for users to manage their billing information.

---

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

- Write unit tests using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- Ensure high test coverage for critical components and services.
- Implement end-to-end tests with **Cypress** to validate user flows.
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code linting and formatting consistency.
